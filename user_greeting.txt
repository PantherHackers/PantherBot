Hey new user! Welcome to PantherHackers, we hope you have a lovely stay in our Slack. Here on Slack all PH members can communicate as much as they like, its like a Discord server if you've ever heard of that. We update our members regularly with things happening on campus and events we are hosting in #announcements, but we are a fluid community that meets up all over campus, so check out #random for anything that might be interesting. 
A few ground rules, do not use the "@channel" modifier in large channels like #random, they will be removed. If you need to ping people in #random, please use the "@here" modifier, but use it with sense. Please refrain from spamming channels, and be sure to post things in the relevant channel if possible (cross posting to #random is fine). If you have any computer related questions, #hack-help is your best bet. 
I'm a bot created by other PH members. Sometimes I freak out and make mistakes, if you have any problems with me, be sure to post in #pantherbot-dev. If you have any questions about PH, message @braxton (the Slack manager).
