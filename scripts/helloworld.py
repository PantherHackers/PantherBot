    # Example, if I have ["Hello", "World"] PantherBot would send two messages, the first being "Hello," the second "World".
    # Likewise, ["Hello World"] will have PB send one message, being "Hello World".
    # Sometimes your logic may be working with an array of strings already, so its fine to just return that (dont return an array containing arrays, plz.)
